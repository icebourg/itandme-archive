<div class='post_body'>For the last 28 days, I have had an HTC EVO 4G. I'm returning it to Sprint and getting an iPhone 4G instead. I had an iPhone 3G for about 7 months prior to this, and I was really interested to try Android out, especially after hearing several people rave about the Android OS.<p /><div><b>But first, why did you get the EVO to begin with?</b></div><div>I really appreciated the geekiness of the phone. It has the largest screen of any phone (it's like a mini-tablet), has wimax built in, and dual cameras.</div><p /><div>I especially wanted the dual cameras without Apple's restrictions on Facetime. That was a huge selling point and a real motivator for getting me to sign on the dotted line.</div><p /><div><b>The Good</b></div><div>I really liked these things about my EVO:</div><p /><div>- Screen size. Yes, it's enormous. But it easily fit in my pocket, so I never minded. It made reading text easier, and surfing the web better. I really liked having the big screen, all other phones seem like a step back.</div><p /><div>- 4G. Ok, truth be told, I never actually got 4G service. Denver is supposed to get it later this year and I wanted the Evo so I could try it out. I still think it would be cool. But I'm sure it will make its already unacceptable battery that much worse.</div><p /><div>- Google Voice integration. This is killer. I use Google voice as my primary number, so having this tight integration rocks. So much better than iPhone.</div><p /><div>- Over the air syncing. If you want this on iPhone, you have to fork around $100/yr for Mobile Me. All of this comes free on Android. Love it.</div><p /><div>- More hardware buttons. I liked having the return button on my phone. When I switched to my iPad, I kept missing that button. Nice to have a standard place for it.</div><p /><div>- Voice transcription / search. So cool! Everywhere text input is accepted, you can hit a button and speak and Google will transcribe for you. Very handy, and shockingly better than the Google Voice voicemail transcription.</div><p /><div>- Built in GPS receiver. I was sitting on a plane, without any cell connectivity, and was reading my latitude/longitude, speed, acceleration, etc. Nice to have this built in so you can get it without having to rely on cell networks.</div><p /><div>- Free turn by turn directions. Apple blocks these free apps from the app store. It's really nice to have it when you need it. (Like when you travel to Tennessee to launch a new campus and you've never been before.)</div><p /><div>- The camera. The camera quality was awesome. Easily replaced the point and shoot camera I was carrying around with me. Took great photos and I loved it! (the giant camera in the back is one of the major reasons I bought the EVO)</div><p /><div>- Widgets. I really like being able to have widgets on my home screen. I also like not having to have every single app on my home screen. This really appeals to my inner neat-nic.</div><p /><div><b>The Bad</b></div><div>- Location services. Seriously, Google? Now the EVO has built in GPS (see above), but &nbsp;it takes 30-60 seconds for it to lock on to the satellites and find your location. Also, GPS drains your battery faster, and may not be available deep in a building. For these reasons, Android has to rely on other signals to determine your location while it waits for a GPS signal. Android tries to determine your rough location based on cell towers and wifi signals. Unfortunately, these signals were frequently <i>very</i>&nbsp;wrong on my EVO, showing me to be thousands of feet to several miles away from where I really am. Of course, if and when the GPS signal locked in, it would automatically correct itself, but having to wait a minute or two to check into Gowalla quickly became very frustrating. Especially since that was one of my top phone uses.</div><p /><div>I do not know why my EVO had a such terrible time finding my location without true GPS. My (non-3G) iPad finds my exact location about 95% of the time in under 2 seconds. And the only signals it has to rely on are Wifi.</div><p /><div>- The menu button. One of the physical buttons on the evo is a menu button. I thought this was a great idea at first because it would help declutter the touch interfaces and provide a more streamlined and consistent interface. I think there's still potential for that, but most apps are not using it well. The most blatant example of this is the Evernote app. When you open the app, you have 4 buttons for creating new notes. No buttons for getting to your existing notes, until you hit menu. I have used this app dozens of times and this still causes a mental speed bump every time I use the app.</div><p /><div>The menu button is like the right click on the PC world. Don't hide primary options behind a context menu. Speaking of bad UI...</div><p /><div>- There is no discernible consistent UI vision. Each app is slightly different, works slightly differently, and you have to switch mental models each time you switch apps. It's very jarring. Apple has done a very good job at enforcing some consistent UI standards. I'm not saying those standards are the best, or that Android needs to have the same standards, but consistent UI is really nice.</div><p /><div>- I never really liked the built in browser. Anytime you would zoom in, it would reflow all of the text. In theory, this should make it easier to read/use, but it added annoying delays, and frequently messed up pictures. (eg, I would want to zoom in on a picture, and instead I wound up zooming on the text which rearranged all the pages. Frustrating.)</div><p /><div>- The built in keyboard auto-correct is terrible. Mostly by being a combination of dumb and aggressive. On the iPhone I would frequently type things like im, its, and whats which it would autocorrect to I'm, it's, and what's automatically. It was consistent, predictable, and rarely got in your way even if (especially if) the word wasn't in your dictionary. The EVO seems to want to correct every word it doesn't know about. This would be fine if it had a huge dictionary and only truly unusual words would throw it, but that isn't the case. For example,&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/jmccartie/">jmccartie</a>&nbsp;had to teach his EVO that burrito is a real world. I eventually just turned off the autocorrect because I would rather live with the small occasional typos I made, then the larger more frequent word replacement errors it made.</div><p /><div><b>The Ugly</b></div><p /><div>- Battery Life. Battery life simply sucks. There's no two ways about it. Especially if you are using the camera a lot and geotagging photos. This activates almost all the sensors (camera, speaker for the camera noises, GPS receiver to geotag the photos, screen, CPU for processing, SD Card for saving, etc) so you can expect worse battery life if you are going to take a lot of photos. However, this was one of my primary use cases for this phone, and after taking only a few dozen photos (a<i>&nbsp;tiny</i>&nbsp;amount for me), I had to recharge my phone. In one day, I had to recharge my phone 3 times just because I was taking a few photos here and there. (no more than 100 or so for the whole day... exactly 0 with flash)</div><p /><div>You can improve the battery life quite a bit by disabling the "Always on Mobile Data" option. (<a href="http://www.josht.com/2010/06/htc-evo-and-its-battery.html">thanks to Josh Turmel</a>&nbsp;for figuring this one out) and, unless I was taking pictures, this was enough for me to get to the end of the day with some battery life to spare. (usually 15-25% by bed time) Unfortunately, this seems to stop some push alerts from coming in until you wake up your phone. I still got Exchange alerts, and regular texts for example, but Gmail alerts and Google Voice texts would only come in after I was using the phone for a bit, never while the phone slept.</div><p /><div>- Fragmented Android ecosystem. The Android ecosystem is a mess. You don't really run "Android" per se unless you have a Nexus One. In all other cases you have the "HTC Android" OS, or the "Samsung Android" OS, etc. You're really at their mercy if they will update you or not, and for when it will happen. Imagine if the same thing happened to PCs? What if you had a "Dell Windows XP" and an "ASUS Windows Vista" and a "Lenovo Windows 7". And you had to wait for each company to large chunks of the OS and customize it for your exact model PC before you could upgrade. I think that would have really stunted the growth of the PC market. I can't see this practice being good for Android in the long run. It makes things really confusing to consumers, and all it will take is for customers being burned by this fragmentation a couple times before Android is a non-starter. (imho of course)</div><p /><div>- Games. Sorry, but Android is bringing a knife to a gun fight here. One of the <i>primary</i>&nbsp;things I do with my mobile devices is game. Have you seen the games available for Android vs iPhone? iPhone has a ton of great and very advanced games available. I was frankly stunned the first time I downloaded a 3D racing game on my iPod touch. I had no idea it held so much power. The EVO is even more powerful than that original iPod touch, so I should be able to get tons of cool, graphical games, right? Wrong. Some of the top games for Android are.... Snake and Brick breaker.</div><p /><div>Really? Really? My 'dumb' phone that couldn't do anything could do those games. Where are all the really cool games with 3d and great visuals? I know the hardware can do it, and I am sure there are a few odd games out there, but iPhone is whomping Android in this fight. It's not even close. Not even 10 miles close. I don't know why there's a disconnect, but it is there.</div><p /><div>- Video chatting. With the front-facing camera, this is one of the main features I bought the EVO for. I knew you could chat with desktop Skype users using the Fring Android client and I even got a demo of it before I bought, but I found the real world experience to be horrifyingly bad. It only worked once or twice in the dozens of times I tried, and when it did work, the sound quality was unusable, and there was a 4-5 seconds of delay. Perhaps it would have been better if I used Qik to chat with another EVO user, but that wasn't what I bought the phone for.</div><p /><div><b>Conclusion</b></div><div>Ultimately, I have a huge library of iPhone apps, and iPhone fits better with the other puzzle pieces of my life. I think the EVO is a good phone, especially from a hardware perspective, but I think Android is really being objectively defeated by the iOS platform. Sprint has a great network and some very compelling features (such as truly unlimited data, and unlimited mobile to mobile on any network) and if you are looking for a very good phone and can live with the asterisks (poor battery, odd UI, no decent games, etc) I think the EVO is a great phone.</div><p /><div>It's just not for me.</div></div>

<div class='response_body'>Awesome post, AJ! I really like how you broke down all of the pros and cons of the Evo. For a while, I was debating whether to get an iPhone or an Android phone and I came to the same conclusion that you did. Let me be clear, I'm definitely not an Android hater, but iPhone seems to fit much better in my life. For example, I wake up listening to music, drive to work listening to podcasts, work while jamming to any of my dozens of playlists and usually listen to podcasts when I come home. iPhone just makes is super easy for me to manage all of that. I also LOVE the prettiness of the apps in iPhone. To be honest, I really don't have any major complaints about my iPhone... and I really like it!<p>Anyway, awesome post. Keep 'em comin'.</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>You're a "hacker" right?  Put 2.2 on it... will solve most of your complaints (battery included)... that's the beauty of Android, you can.<p>I'm not experiencing the battery and GPS issues you speak of, so I can't provide any input there.</p><p>Games are coming, developers are moving over (hear about new one's all the time) and 2.2 brings apps to sd card which is the big reason there was such a hold up (storage space.)</p><p>JT</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>@ddemoss if you're into podcasts then you'd love Google Listen (Android app), manage all your podcasts on the phone in the app or with rest of your RSS feeds in Google Reader and have them automatically sync to your phone through the cloud, without having to hook your phone up to your machine to get them.  I'm guessing something like this would never be allowed on the iPhone since it would compete with Apple's own offering, this just bothers me.  Apple's not the best at everything they do.</div>

<div class='response_body'>OK first things first... there is NO (absolutely NO) iPhone 4G. its just iPhone 4 because it can't do 4g networks.<br />Next, most of your complaints can be fixed with a software upgrade or a rooting solution.<br />On top of that the it seems you have an unexplained love for Apple. While I love iPods, Macs, and most other Apple products (owning all but an iPad because I don't like tablets), i think that iPhone leaves a lot to be desired in most of the areas you hit. Especially since almost every apple iOS update involves ideas straight from Android and or Jailbreak..... beyond unoriginal.</div>

<div class='response_body'>The iPhone 4G thing was a simple typo, Ian.<p>I think you need to relax a little, Ian. I gave the Evo 4G a fair run, I really wanted to like it when I got it because I never really liked the the iPhone 4 update, and I found a lot of things to like about Android. But the drawbacks were just too great for my needs. Remember, this is why AJ returned the Evo, not Ian or anybody else.</p><p>I made a similar post about my experiences with the iPhone, and the things I love and hate about the iPhone. <a href="http://itand.me/iphone-4-impressions" rel="nofollow">http://itand.me/iphone-4-impressions</a></p><p>PS: This post is 5+ months old. I'm sure the software landscape has changed since then.</p></div>
