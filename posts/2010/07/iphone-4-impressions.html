<div class='post_body'><p>As you all know, I had an HTC EVO 4G for a month which I <a href="http://itand.me/the-evo-4g-why-im-returning-it-and-getting-an">returned</a> under Sprint&rsquo;s great 30 day money back guarantee. And much to Sprint&rsquo;s credit, they gave me no real hassle and returned my money. My experience with Sprint, despite the lackluster phone, couldn&rsquo;t have been better.</p>

<p>I replaced that phone with the iPhone 4 and have been giving it its workout for the same 30 days and wanted to tell you what I like and don&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s just hop in.</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Love the speed improvements. They&rsquo;ve really optimized the right actions and made it feel much much faster than before. Especially when switching apps and using the camera app.</p></li>
<li><p>Love the new multiple Exchange account feature. Before, I could only have one push Gmail account because push Gmail uses the Exchange Active Sync protocol. Now I can have my personal email pushed as well as my work email.</p></li>
<li><p>I really like the new design. The previous plastic design feels so cheap and shoddy in comparison. I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the new design at first, but the steel and glass has really grown on me.</p></li>
<li><p>Folders! About time. My home screen was just a mess without folders.</p></li>
<li><p>Nice, high quality camera. Love how the new camera performs. I stopped carrying my point and shoot with me thanks to the iPhone camera.</p></li>
<li><p>Battery life. I easily get a day out of it, sometimes a day and a half depending on use. The EVO could not compare at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The headphone remote. I really like being able to place calls, end calls, listen to music, change tracks, etc with just the headphones. Can keep the phone in my pocket while I am talking on the phone.</p></li>
<li><p>The AT&amp;T A-List. I signed up for the more expensive plan and got free 5 phone numbers I could call any time. Given that there&rsquo;s probably no more than 3-4 numbers I call regularly, this is a great deal. Then I have 900 minutes with rollover I can use for all other situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Awesome awesome apps. Despite Apple&rsquo;s developer-unfriendly system, there are a ton of great apps and they are all miles ahead of the competition. Some of my favorite apps right now: Gowalla, Twitter, Instapaper, Things, Evernote and, of course, the <a href="http://www.youversion.com/mobile/iphone">YouVersion App</a>. (full disclosure: I work there) Even when there are Android equivalents, I think the iPhone app is better. For example, I think Evernote on Android is an UI disaster, but awesome on iPhone.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>The Not So Good</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The whole antenna issue. It&rsquo;s something of an issue, if I hold my iPhone just right I can see the bars go down significantly. However, for my use, the antenna issue hasn&rsquo;t impaired my phone use one bit. I haven&rsquo;t had a single dropped call while holding the phone so I am not too worried about it. (more on dropped calls in a bit)</p></li>
<li><p>I am really worried about its fragility. I am concerned that I am going to drop it and shatter it in a million pieces, Worse, at home repair is going to be made more difficult by the fact that the screen is glued to the glass. I&rsquo;ve replaced 3G screens myself with no trouble, but this worries me just a little bit.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>The Ugly</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>AT&amp;T. You knew this was coming. Their network sucks, their prices are too high, and you have to pay an extra $20 a month to get unlimited text messaging. A service that costs them nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>The buying experience. Surprisingly, it took me an hour and a half at the Apple store to buy an iPhone. I&rsquo;ve never had a bad experience at an Apple store and so this was my first time having any issues at all at Apple. It&rsquo;s not really Apple&rsquo;s fault though because AT&amp;T rejected my order. I don&rsquo;t know why, probably because I had a Colorado billing address but was buying/activating it in Oklahoma City. Best part of the day was when the Apple store guy called the AT&amp;T guy a &ldquo;douche&rdquo; and then took me back to the super secret employee-only section.</p>

<p>  In contrast, I was in and out of the Sprint store in like 15 minutes. (no one was there&hellip;) I told them I wanted a Colorado number and they didn&rsquo;t bat an eye. And Sprint gave me the correct area code (303) for my billing address, while AT&amp;T gave me a long distance area code (970). Sigh.</p></li>
<li><p>Dropped calls. I think this is more in line with my location at the time, but I had a terrible time with dropped calls for a while in one particular (2nd floor) room. It wasn&rsquo;t the Antennagate issue because I never held the phone, and always was using headphones while doing something else. Fortunately, I have not yet had this issue since I&rsquo;ve been back in Colorado. I think it was just one dead spot I was in in OKlahoma that caused the issue. (but I never had a single issue with Sprint dropping any calls anywhere)</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>What iPhone Could Learn From Android</h1>

<p>All that said, I think the iPhone is the best phone available. If you can put up with AT&amp;T (I can) then I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s even a question: get the iPhone.</p>

<p>But, despite my criticism, Android is a great system and for many people, they will love it. There are a number of things that Android does really well that I think the iPhone can learn from.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better cooperation. This is something everybody learns in pre-school. Each app on iPhone feels like a discreet unit without any context or association with any other app. This needs to change. Apps need to be able to interact with each other better. A perfect example of this is in the camera app. On Android, I can take a picture and hit a sharing button and it will ask me which app to share the picture with. It will show me any app I&rsquo;ve installed that can handle pictures, like all of my Twitter clients.</p>

<p>  iPhone, not so much. I can email the photo, but that&rsquo;s about it. To share it, I have to open whatever program I want to use, and then find the picture I wanted to share. Lots of context switching, not much sharing.</p>

<p>  I think iPhone is slowly working its way there, the new OS will ask you which application to open a Word doc emailed to you, for example. I am sure Apple will eventually expand this api to other services, but until then, I have to keep reminding myself where to go.</p></li>
<li><p>Better app shortcut management. I hate having every single icon on my home screen. Most of my apps sit unused. Folders helps this somewhat, but in someways, it makes it more of a pain. In Android, I only had two home screens of icons I used frequently. Everything else I just accessed through the All Apps button. I would love that on my iPhone.</p></li>
<li><p>Widgets. I am still shocked that Apple hasn&rsquo;t created widgets for iOS. It&rsquo;s such a no-brainer. I really liked being able to have a selection of weather, clock, calendar, Twitter, Facebook, etc widgets I could put straight on the home screen. Apple already has the technology on the Mac.</p>

<p>  This is so obvious to me, that I think one of the next few releases (potentially for WWDC &lsquo;11) will be widget support on the iPhone, a widget store in iTunes, and native support in Dashcode. It&rsquo;s an obvious line extension, and could be a nice couple hundred million add on for iTunes.</p>

<p>  But I am a terrible predictor of Jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>A loosened collar. Sorry Apple, you need to stop being so anti-competitive and loosen your grip a bit on the whole ecosystem. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re in any danger of losing their lead anytime soon (Jobs has been through this before, and is older and wiser and I think is a couple steps ahead of the rest of us) but they are going to face increasing competitive and legislative pressure for their measures soon.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I had an iPhone 3G for a while and really liked it. iPhone 4 is a big upgrade, and solved all of the complaints I had with a 3G. I have been very happy with my iPhone 4, and you can pry it from my cold, dead hands.</p></div>
