<div class='post_body'><p>We continue to push forward with our new Puppet platform. <a href="http://itand.me/using-puppet-to-manage-users-passwords-and-ss">In part 1</a> I shared how we use Puppet to manage users centrally without any central authentication servers. (NIS, LDAP, etc)</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to share how we use puppet to manage a diverse set of iptables on diversely configured equipment. There are probably a thousand different ways to configure puppet to manage iptables, each with its own pros and cons. This is way #1001.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>Our iptables setup revolves around the concept of file fragments. I intentionally modeled it after how Debian packages all their httpd servers such as Apache, lighttpd, and nginx.</p>

<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know, Debian&rsquo;s packaging for nginx configuration looks something like this:</p>

<p>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
/etc/nginx/sites-available/
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/</p>

<p>All of your site configuration files go in the sites-available folder. Then when you are ready to enable a site, you just put a symlink in the sites-enabled folder pointing to the config file you want to enable in sites-available. I have grown to become a big fan of this setup. To the point that I am duplicating this exact setup for iptables.</p>

<p>So, within puppet, I have setup the following file structure on each managed server:</p>

<p>/etc/iptables/
/etc/iptables/config-available/
/etc/iptables/config-enabled/</p>

<p>All of the configuration in config-available is prepared in advance by me and distributed by puppet to each node. Within puppet, I tell it which files to copy from config-available to config-enabled. (I do not symlink the files <a href="http://itand.me/old-dog-new-tricks-2">because of an issue in puppet</a>)</p>

<p>Each configuration file is really just a shell script. I wrote another shell script (init-iptables.sh) that looks in the config-enabled directory and just executes everything it finds there. Puppet is configured to run init-iptables.sh any time config-enabled is updated. A copy of the file is placed in /etc/network/if-up.d/ directory so that the iptables rules will reload upon boot-up.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>This is iptables.pp, which defines the iptables class and a function for enabling configuration.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class iptables {

            package { iptables:
                    ensure  =&gt; installed,
            }

            file { [ &quot;/etc/iptables&quot;, &quot;/etc/iptables/config-enabled&quot; ]:
                    ensure  =&gt; directory,
                    mode    =&gt; 755,
                    owner   =&gt; root,
                    group   =&gt; root,
            }

            exec { &quot;/narnia/tools/initiptables.sh&quot;:
                    #subscribe      =&gt; file[&quot;/etc/iptables/config-available&quot;],
                    refreshonly     =&gt; true,
                    require         =&gt; [ package[iptables], exec[update-narnia] ],
            }

            file { &quot;/etc/network/if-up.d/iptables&quot;:
                    ensure  =&gt; file,
                    mode    =&gt; 755,
                    source  =&gt; &quot;/narnia/tools/initiptables.sh&quot;,
                    require =&gt; [ package[iptables], exec[update-narnia] ]
            }
    }

    #
    #
    # Enable a certain script file by copying it from /etc/iptables/
    #  config-available to /etc/iptables/config-enabled and running it.
    #
    #

    define enable-iptables () {

            include iptables

            $script = &quot;/etc/iptables/config-enabled/${title}.sh&quot;

            # Make sure the file has the proper copy, and notify the iptables
            # script to run

            file { $script:
                    ensure  =&gt; file,
                    source  =&gt;  &quot;/narnia/config/etc/iptables/config-available/${title}.sh&quot;,
                    require =&gt; [ file[&quot;/etc/iptables/config-enabled&quot;], exec[update-narnia] ],
                    notify  =&gt; exec[&quot;/narnia/tools/initiptables.sh&quot;],
            }
    }</pre></div>
</div>


<p>A couple of things to note here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Narnia is our shared &ldquo;file-system&rdquo; (really just an rsync'ed directory under /narnia). All nodes share a copy of this server. exec[update-narnia] is defined elsewhere and just ensures that the copy has been rsynced before proceeding. I will blog about this at some point.</li>
<li>We are running 100% Debian. Package names, locations of config files, etc may vary if you use a different distribution.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is the initiptables.sh script:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>#!/bin/bash

    # we will iterate over this directory and run every script in it
    dir=`ls /etc/iptables/config-enabled/`

    # but first, clear the existing iptables rules for a fresh slate
    iptables -F
    iptables -X

    # now iterate over each enabled config which will populate new iptables rules
    for file in $dir
    do
            /etc/iptables/config-enabled/$file
    done</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Pretty simple. Just open the config-enabled directory and execute everything you find. This file lives in /narnia and puppet automatically calls it any time we update the config-enabled directory. It also lives as a copy in /etc/network/if-up.d/iptables which will ensure all the config-enabled rules will be executed when the network interface is brought up.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s a sample rule. I rate limit SSH to help limit brute-force attacks. I know about Fail2Ban, DenyHosts, etc, this is just a simple way to keep people from abusing our servers. ssh.sh:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>#!/bin/bash

    # Limit SSH connections to 3 every 90 seconds. Throttle it down to help limit
    # bruteforce attempts as much as possible. Must have an relevant kernel.

    # This notes every NEW connection to port 22 (ssh) and adds it to the recent &quot;list&quot;
    iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set

    # If your IP is on the recent list, and you have 4 or more entries on the list in the
    # last 90 seconds, we drop your request. Buh bye!
    iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 90 --hitcount 4 -j DROP</pre></div>
</div>


<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>The iptables.pp class needs to be available on the puppetmaster in /etc/puppet/manifests/classes/iptables.pp.</p>

<p>The initiptables.sh and ssh.sh scripts need to be available to each node. We use narnia and put initiptables.sh in /narnia/tools/initiptables.sh and ssh will go in /narnia/config/etc/iptables/config-available/ssh.sh. You do not need your own Narnia to make this work, but you do need some way to get these files to your nodes. (you can use puppet&rsquo;s built-in mechanism)</p>

<p>Here is a portion of our /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp file where we add the SSH rule to a host:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>node debiandev inherits default {
        # SSH rate limiter
        enable-iptables{ ssh: }
    }</pre></div>
</div>


<p>We don&rsquo;t need to include iptables here because the enable-iptables function does that for us.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! Let me know if you have any questions in the comments. If you liked this blog, let me know so I know it&rsquo;s valuable to someone.</p>
