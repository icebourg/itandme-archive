<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />My name is AJ Bourg and I am a sysadmin for <a href="http://www.lifechurch.tv/">LifeChurch.tv</a>. I get to work on cool things like <a href="http://www.youversion.com/">YouVersion</a>, <a href="http://live.lifechurch.tv/">Church Online</a>, and other great LC.tv stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Schmegal</strong><br />As most any blogger, the things I say are my words, they belong to me and are my responsibility. One of the great things about LifeChurch.tv is that they encourage blogging and social media because they understand its power, so I am not doing anything wrong by blogging, but they also don’t screen anything so these words are mine alone. LC.tv approves <em>that</em> I blog, but does not necessarily approve <em>what</em> I blog. (and who would, anyway? ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Open</strong><br />This gets straight to the heart of one of the reasons I was really excited to start at LC.tv, and that’s the spirit of openness and sharing so prevalent here. This culture of sharing is evident in many things that LC.tv does. In case you weren’t aware of some of the things we do:</p>
<p><a href="http://open.lifechurch.tv/">OPEN</a> provides thousands of free resources for churches to use and incorporate. From worship songs to graphics to message outlines to video messages. It’s pretty awesome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youversion.com/live/">YouVersion Live</a> provides an online way to interact live with worship services and other live events.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youversion.com/">YouVersion</a> which is an online Bible provides tons of different translations in several different languages, plus reading plans and community features.</p>
<p><a href="http://swerve.lifechurch.tv/">Swerve</a> the leadership blog by Craig Groeschel and Bobby Gruenewald.</p>
<p>Plus much, much more in the blogs and twitterings of staff.</p>
<p><strong>A Passion of Mine</strong><br />Here is something I am growing to be more and more passionate about: pouring what I know into others so they can utilize their full potential. Sharing what little I know, so you can go maybe just an inch further than you would have otherwise. Much of that was borne out of hearing Andy Stanley’s thoughts on “intentional apprenticing” in the <a href="http://resources.northpoint.org/store/shop.do?pID=318">Simply Irresistible</a> series. The idea of always teaching what you know to somebody else, always replacing yourself, always empowering and involving others is really beautiful.</p>
<p>It’s what Jesus did. Jesus said that he did only what he saw the Father doing. Paul encouraged us to imitate him, as he imitates Christ.</p>
<p>Volumes could be written on this. I have been working on how to express this well for 4+ years. But suffice it to say that if you’re always working to pour yourself out to others you yourself will always be improving too. You’re not only building up the next generation (which is probably among the most rewarding things you can do) but you’re also pushing yourself to improve and change and grow. Even though we use the analogy of pouring ourselves out into the cups of others, we’re not losing anything. We’re gaining.</p>
<p>And this is something I’ve really been interested in through the years. Through college I spent a few years leading a team of high school / middle school students in student tech ministry. I never had anything to do with the sermons, or the worship, but always worked to build a platform for those who did. I didn’t have much to do with the students that attended the service, but I had a lot to do with those that volunteered their time under my leadership.</p>
<p>This is true the last time I was on a church IT staff, though I lead no one. I didn’t have anything to do with the preaching and teaching, or the worship music. But I could pour out and teach the staff how to use technology better.</p>
<p>It’s the same at LC.tv. I don’t preach or teach, I don’t build the website. I don’t directly interact with people that I impact. And really, anybody could do what I do. There isn’t anything special to me.<span>  </span>There are many people that can do everything I can do ten times better than I ever could <em>hope</em> to do it.</p>
<p>But what I can do, and what excited me a lot about LC.tv culture is the culture of sharing. The culture of pouring out what I’ve got, what I’ve been given, even when what I have may be small, and giving it away. For free. No strings attached.</p>
<p>You learn something small from me, and I think I will learn something big from you. Whenever I’ve poured out in to someone else, I’ve always learned so much more from those experiences than I think I’ve ever taught. It may seem generous, but it’s one of the most selfish things I could ever do.</p>
<p>So that’s the start of my blog. Who starts a blog off with a manifesto of sharing? It’s crazy. But in 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, I want to know why I started. I don’t want to forget that it started, not because I wanted to prop up my ego. Not because I wanted to share all of my opinions. But because I wanted to teach someone something, even something small. And learn something big in the process.</p>
