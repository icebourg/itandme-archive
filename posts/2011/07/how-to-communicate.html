<div class='post_body'><p>This is going to be a real back to basics post. This isn't about Linux, or commands, or routers or cables. This isn't about technology at all. This is about something much more basic: communication.</p>
<p>If you're in any sort of technology position, you may think your job is technology. This couldn't be further from the truth. Your job is really about <em>customer service</em>. Even if you work from home and your only venture out doors is late at night when the scary sun has left the sky, you are still providing a service, and you are providing it to a customer. It could be a boss, a client, coworkers, or even an entire organization. Someone uses the code you write, the services you configure, and the servers you setup.</p>
<p>Say customer service and you think of waiting on hold, frustrations, and accents you can barely understand. I bet you don't think anything you do is customer service at all.&nbsp;And this is what separates the men from the boys when it comes to technology positions. Your job is not just the technical details, but also the interactions and communication with others. Customer service is just about communication. And communication is not a boring and mindless tedium, but a necessity because you're working with people. And people need to communicate. Treat this as a second class pursuit only interesting to English majors at your own peril. I rarely endorse the things 37Signals does, but one thing they get quite right: <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20100601/never-read-another-resume.html">when in doubt, always hire the better writer</a>.</p>
<p>That is why, when I get terrible communication from someone, I just want to go into a rage. Consider this email that I just got this morning:</p>
