<div class='post_body'>One thing that I think Apple really got right is iChat. Works great with AIM and Jabber, does audio, video and... screen sharing.<p />I&#39;ve used screen sharing many times to help friends when merely explaining something just isn&#39;t enough. I still get a twinge of feeling like I live with the Jetsons when I realize I&#39;m controlling a magical little box hundreds or thousands of miles away, and actions take only milliseconds to get there and back. How cool is technology!?<p /> The coolest thing is that you can use iChat for very fast and easy screen sharing if you&#39;re going to be a long way from home. No human required to accept the connection on the other end. Here&#39;s all you have to do:<p /> 1) Get a dedicated IM account for your &quot;remote&quot; account. I use Google apps for my personal domains, so I just setup a special account just for it.<p />2) Add your new IM account as a buddy for your normal iChat account.<p /> 3) On the remote end, right click your buddy in the buddy list, click show info. Under alerts, choose &quot;Invitation to Share My Screen&quot;, check the box to run an AppleScript and choose Auto Accept.<p /> <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />Bam! You now have a secure and easy way to reconnect to your Mac from anywhere in the world. You don&#39;t have to remember your IP address, configure ports on your firewall, setup an ssh tunnel.<p /> If you&#39;re like me, and you only occasionally want to access your home Mac from the road, this is a very quick and easy solution. All I do whenever I leave for a trip is fire up iChat, re-enable my remote account, spend 5 seconds of testing to make sure it works, and I&#39;m done...<p /> Of course, if you need to access your Mac from a PC, or if you use remote access often, you&#39;ll probably want to check out setting up a <a href="http://howto.diveintomark.org/remote-mac/" target="_blank">VNC server</a>, or using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_My_Mac" target="_blank">Back to My Mac</a>. The coolest thing about Back to My Mac is that if you have an Apple Airport Extreme or Time Capsule, you can put your Mac to sleep and it will wake it up wirelessly.<br /> <p></p><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
