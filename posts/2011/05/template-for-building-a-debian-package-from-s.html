<h3>Template for Building a Debian Package from Scratch</h3>

<div class='post_body'><p>Previously, I&rsquo;ve shared how I build <a href="http://itand.me/building-custom-debian-packages">custom Debian packages</a> based on existing Debian packages. But sometimes the package you want to build is not actually provided by Debian, or you just want to start from scratch. Fortunately, that&rsquo;s almost easier to set up! Here&rsquo;s the short and simple way I do it.</p>

<p><strong>Setting Up</strong></p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s set up our directories:</p>

<p>mkdir ~/packages/php/core</p>

<p>Second, let&rsquo;s download the source. Say PHP:</p>

<p>wget <a href="http://us3.php.net/get/php-5.3.5.tar.gz/from/this/mirror">http://us3.php.net/get/php-5.3.5.tar.gz/from/this/mirror</a> -o php-5.3.5.tar.gz</p>

<p>Unzip it</p>

<p>tar -xvzf php-5.3.5.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd php-5.3.5</p>

<p><strong>Make Special debian/ Directory</strong></p>

<p>Run dh_make to build the debian/ directory</p>

<p>dh_make &mdash;createorig</p>

<p>At this point you can edit any file in the debian/ directory to tweak or change anything you need. (like runtime or build dependencies) I usually like to change the version in debian/changelog to include my own version number so when I run dpkg -l I can tell it&rsquo;s my package that&rsquo;s installed, and which one. I like to add the format -AJB.0 to the end of the upstream version.</p>

<p><strong>Build the package</strong></p>

<p>Now, run</p>

<p>dpkg-buildpackage</p>

<p>This actually builds the software. If there&rsquo;s a failure, you probably will need to download headers or something for a dependency. You should update the dependencies list in debian/control with the new package so that it&rsquo;s used.</p>

<p><strong>Finished!</strong></p>

<p>Once dpkg-buildpackage does its thing, you&rsquo;re technically done and good. However, you probably will want to verify that your package&rsquo;s dependencies are correctly set and that the package can install in a clean Debian environment without any trouble. For this, pbuilder is very useful.</p>

<p>There is, of course, <strong>significantly</strong> more to do to completely finish building a true Debian package, and much of that is controlled in the debian subdirectory. But this should get you off to a good start.</p></div>
