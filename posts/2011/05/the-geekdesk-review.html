<div class='post_body'>This isn't strictly an IT post. But IT people are desk people, and desk people do a lot of sitting. I'm fortunate that I get to work from home, so I really do a lot of sitting.<p /><div>A few months back, this had really started to wear on me. I'm used to doing a fair amount of walking every week (usually 1.5-2 miles a day at least), and thanks to graduating college and switching jobs, I found myself not doing very much walking at all. This really started to be pronounced in my back and shoulders, and I found myself in a lot of pain sitting at my desk.</div><p /><div>It got to the point that I was in so much pain that I started to work on my couch, at my kitchen table, and at my kitchen bar–which is a nice standing height. I also started walking and bicycling again much more regularly—it's too easy to kill your exercise routines in the snowy winter. All these changes started to help, so I decided to seriously think about throwing some money into an adjustable standing desk. A boss of mine at a former company had terrible back problems, and the company bought him a really nice standing desk which helped.</div><p /><div>I'm funding this on my own, so I had to be a little more economical. Fortunately, I've known about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geekdesk.com/">GeekDesk</a>&nbsp;for a few years and have heard that they are of good quality, and they have everything I would need.</div><p /><div>There are two really great things about GeekDesk:</div><p /><div>1) The 30 day money back guarantee. I've never spent $700+ on a single piece of furniture, so I was quite hesitant about wasting a bunch of money on something that sucks. Fortunately, GeekDesk has a 30 day money back guarantee that says that if you don't like the desk, return it for a full refund, including shipping. I probably wouldn't have purchased without this kind of guarantee. It really made me feel a lot more comfortable about spending so much money on one piece of furniture.</div><p /><div>2) GeekDesk sells their desks at a discount without the top. You can get the stand only for a $120 discount.</div><p /><div>This is where I got a crazy idea. I can get a desk top for way less than $120. So I bought the desk, and went to my nearest Home Depot and did something a little crazy: I bought a 4x8 slab of plywood for my desk top. Yes, you read that right. 4 Feet by 8 Feet. That is a big desk!</div><p /><div>I select the only wood in the store that I could find that had no visible warping or bending on the shelves. Loaded it up in my brother's truck, and stained and sanded it, now it makes a great (and very LARGE) desk top.</div><p /><div>I really love my new desk, and am extremely happy with being able to quickly alternate between standing or sitting position. Between this and getting outside again for regular exercise, I've felt a noticeable difference in my energy and focus. Being able to adjust the height of your desk inch by inch whether you're sitting or standing makes a big difference in comfort, and is a big reason I opted to go this route instead of the more economical fixed standing desk.</div><p /><div>Now for some pictures.</div><p /><div>My view when working:</div><p /><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p><p></p><p /><p /><div>The controls are pretty simple, you press the button on the left and hold it while pressing up or down on the button on the right. Some desks are really fancy, and have an LCD panel, and presets and all this other stuff, but I find the controls here to be more than sufficient.</div><p /><p /><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</div>
</p><p></p><p /><p /><div>Overall, I'm extremely happy with my desk. It was the most expensive piece of furniture I've ever purchased, but I'm at my desk at all hours of the day, and it's more of an investment in helping to ensure that I don't have terrible back or shoulder pain down the road. I've been saving up and planning this upgrade for years, and finally just had to pull the trigger and do it. I highly recommend it for any one else that spends a lot of time sitting in front of a computer.</div></div>

<div class='response_body'>I've actually heard a lot of good things about the GeekDesk (like your review, for example) but it just seems a little... simple to me, I guess. <br />If you're ever looking for something a bit more modern and clean-looking, I recommend the NextDesk Air (I recommend it to practically everyone.)<br />It is adjustable just like the GeekDesk, but it is more modern-looking, made out of recycled aluminum and all eco-friendly and sustainable materials. It also has an adjustable keyboard tray, which I've found to be really important as far as wrist comfort and my posture go.<br />Just thought I'd share another option with you. Thanks for the post!<br />Natalie</div>
