<div class='post_body'><p>One of the cool things at LifeChurch.tv is that Team Digerati once a month gets together and has someone on the team talk about some cool technology and share what they know.</p>
<p>Last month, we had three such talks, and I was one of them. I spoke at length about HAProxy, how we use HAProxy and some of the challenges we've had with HAProxy. If you have any interest, the video and slides are now up <a href="http://digeratidev.tumblr.com/post/10775435877/aj-bourg-haproxy-slides">here</a>.</p></div>
